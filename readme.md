# Radix UI Themes with Tailwind

## Features

- (optional) You can use tailwind naming convention for colors and radius helpers
  - You can still write `bg-red-500` `bg-blue-500` and it will point to radix color
- (optional) You can map missing color tokens from tailwind to radix-colors
  - For example you can map `zinc` to `sand`, `neutral` to `sage`, etc...

## FAQ

### What is/are Radix Themes?

"Radix Themes is just a styled, opinionated component lib on top of the primitives. Itâ€™s made for when you want to kickstart a project with pre-designed, battle-tested components." (from [Radix UI Twitter](https://twitter.com/radix_ui/status/1692574289860477432))

### Do I really need this plugin to use Radix themes?

No, but if you used to tailwind and don't wanna use Radix Themes' layout utilities (`<Box />`, `<Flex />`, `<Grid />` etc...) you can still develop with Tailwind (`className="flex items-center gap-2"`).

### OK, show me a demo!

Sure, coming soon...
